# sql-challenge-SPH

The ERD was created using http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com.

I understand that fields could potential of had better data types such as STR or DATE but for the queires needed the VARCHAR was fine.

The tables should load in correct order after running the QuickDBD sql file.  Data needs to be imported with the CVS after creating the tables

All the Queries should be run seperatly using the employee.sql file.
